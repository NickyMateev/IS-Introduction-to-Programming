# Week 01

## Integrated Development Environment(IDE)

Per Wikipedia:
> An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development.

This is basically the program where you'll write and run your code.

Popular IDEs: **Visual Studio, CodeBlocks, Eclipse, IntelliJ, NetBeans**

Our personal recommendation is to use either CodeBlocks or VisualStudio.

Visual Studio Community: [Download][1]

CodeBlocks: [Download][2]
