## Integrated Development Environment(IDE)

As per Wikipedia:
> An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development.

This is basically the program where you'll write and run your code.

Popular IDEs: **Visual Studio, CodeBlocks, CLion, Eclipse, IntelliJ, NetBeans**

Our personal recommendation is to use either VisualStudio or CLion(more lightweight than VisualStudio). A lot of people use CodeBlocks, but we tend to avoid it due to unexpected computational problems sometimes.

> NOTE: If you decide to go with CLion, keep in mind that it's a **paid IDE**. So you'll only have a **30 day trial** to use it. Fortunately, as students, you can make use of your students rights and through your ISIC cards recieve a free subscription for the IDE for the entirety of your bachelor study(you'll have to renew it every year, but that's easy :)).

#### Step 7:
You've now created your first C++ project in CodeBlocks!

![cb7](/Week01/images/cb7.png)

#### Step 8:
Navigate through the menu on the left, find the **main.cpp** file and double click it. By default CodeBlocks has generated some code for you - the famous *"Hello World!"* program, which prints "Hello World!" to your screen.

#### Step 9:
In order to run the program, just press *F9* and watch in astonishment!

**Congrats, you've now run your first C++ program in CodeBlocks!**

## Bonus: Git and GitHub

Git is a version control system, which is widely used for software development and other version control purposes.

GitHub is a hosting service(a website) for Git repositories.

Git is really the tool that makes all the magic, and GitHub is the site where you can see your projects(more often called repositories) online.
