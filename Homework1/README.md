# Homework 1

## Tasks using *if* :
*Solve the next two tasks by using the if statement.*
#### Task 1:
You are given **5 real numbers** and the task is to print to the screen the biggest one of them. You can use a maximum of **5 if statements** in your solution.

Examples:

| Input                          | Output   |
|--------------------------------|----------|
| 8<br/>8<br/>8<br/>8<br/>8      | 8        |
| 1<br/>-10<br/>0<br/>-1</br>-3  | 1        |


#### Task 2:
You are given **3 integers**. Your task is to display *+*, *-* or *0* depending on the result of the product of the three numbers. If the product is a positive number - print *+*, if it's a negative number - print *-*, if the product is 0 - print 0. **Solve the task without actually calculating the product of the three integers.**

Examples:

| Input           | Output   |
|-----------------|----------|
| 4<br/>2<br/>3   | +        |
| 1<br/>6<br/>-2  | -        |
| 0<br/>13<br/>-2 | 0        |

## Tasks using *ternary operator ?:* :
*Solve the next two tasks by using the ?: operator. You are not allowed to use if statements.*
#### Task 3:
Write a program which takes **two integers** from the user. If the sum of the two is an **even** number, then print to the screen **the sum multiplied by 2**. If the sum of the two is an **odd** number, then print to the screen **the sum divided by 2**.

Examples:

| Input       | Output   |
|-------------|----------|
| 2<br/>5     | 3        |
| 2<br/>4     | 12       |
| 1<br/>3     | 8        |

#### Task 4:
Write a program which takes **two numbers** from the user. Create a **third variable** which takes **the value of the bigger one of the two numbers** that you just inputted. If the result number is a **negative** number, then make it **positive** by multiplying it by **(-1)**. Finally, **print the result** to the screen.

Examples:

| Input       | Output   |
|-------------|----------|
| 2<br/>3     | 3        |
| -2<br/>-4   | 2        |
| -10<br/>-5  | 5        |


## Tasks using *switch* :
*Solve the next task using switch only.*
#### Task 5:
Write a program which **takes an integer** from the user.
 * If the number is between 1 and 3, print to the console that same number *multiplied by 10*.
 * If the number is between 4 and 6, print to the console that same number *multiplied by 100*.
 * If the number is between 7 and 9, print to the console that same number *multiplied by 1000*.
 * If the number is less than or equal to 0 or more than or equal to 10, then print to the screen *"Invalid input."*

Examples:

| Input  | Output        |
|--------|---------------|
| 1      | 10            |
| 5      | 500           |
| 8      | 8000          |
| 10     | Invalid input |
